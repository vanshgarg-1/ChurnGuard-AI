# The Problem: Why Churn Matters
Customer churn is a silent revenue killer. Businesses invest heavily in acquiring customers, only to lose them due to factors like poor service, better competitor offers, or lack of engagement. The challenge lies in identifying at-risk customers before they leave. Traditional approaches rely on historical data and manual analysis, which are time-consuming and often ineffective. Without a proactive solution, businesses are left playing catch-up, losing valuable customers and revenue in the process.


# Solution

This application uses a TensorFlow deep learning model trained on historical customer data to predict churn probability. Key components include:

- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the GUI allows users to input customer demographics, financial metrics, and engagement details.

- Automated Preprocessing: Integrates label encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling to replicate training-phase transformations.

- Real-Time Insights: Outputs a churn probability score (0â€“1) and a binary classification (likely/unlikely to churn).

# Impact
- Retention Optimization: Identifies high-risk customers early, enabling personalized retention efforts.

- Cost Reduction: Lowers customer acquisition costs by prioritizing retention of existing clients.

- Data-Driven Strategy: Supports decision-making with transparent, ML-powered predictions.
# Usages

1. Input customer details (e.g., geography, age, credit score) using dropdown menus, sliders, and number fields.

2. Click Predict Churn to generate results.

3. Interpret the output:

- Churn Probability: A numerical score between 0 and 1.

- Classification: A binary prediction ("likely" or "unlikely" to churn).
# Installation Guide
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

- pip package manager

## Steps To Run Locally

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-churn-prediction.git  
   cd customer-churn-prediction  
```
2. Create a Virtual Environment (recommended for dependency isolation):
```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
4. Place the following files in the Models/ directory:

- Final_model.h5 (pre-trained TensorFlow model)

- label_encoder_gender.pkl, onehot_encoder_geo.pkl, scaler.pkl (preprocessing pipelines)

5. Launch the Application:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-churn-prediction.git  
   cd customer-churn-prediction  
   Create a Virtual Environment (recommended for dependency isolation):
```

- Note: Replace your-repo in the clone command with your repository URL. Ensure model and preprocessing files are available in the Models/ directory before running the app.
